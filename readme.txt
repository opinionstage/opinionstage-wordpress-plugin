== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What sets Opinion Stage polls apart from other polling solutions? =

Opinion Stage polls are social polls which means that social network identities are used for polling the participants. This makes the poll more engaging than the typical poll, letting users discover who supports what and how each user voted in other polls. You can also follow users and then filter the poll results by the people you follow. In addition, using social polls improves the distribution of the poll in social networks. 

= Do you require users to identify by logging-in before voting? =

Yes, we currently support Facebook login, but are working to add additional poll login options such as Twitter. 
 
= Do you support anonymous voting? =

Yes, while you do need to login to participate in the poll, you can vote anonymously so that nobody besides yourself knows what you voted in the poll.

= How do users share the poll & their vote in social networks? = 

Users can either share the poll question from the sharing menu, or share their votes from the Facebook & Twitter sharing buttons that are displayed after voting. We never share anything on the users' behalf.

= What are the benifits of using social polls? =

Using social polls improves user engagement and adds additional traffic from social networks.

= What types of polls do you support? =

We support both regular multiple-sided polls and a special head-to-head poll flavor (for the 2-sided polls)

= Do you plan to add debating capabilities to the poll? =

Yes, we plan to add the option to debate the poll. Users will be able to add a text explanation to their votes so the vote can be debated.

= How do I add a poll to my post/page? =

Follow these steps:

1. Create a new poll from <a href="http://www.opinionstage.com?o=wp-v-readme" target="_blank">here</a>
2. From the poll page, click get code and copy the embed ID 
3. Click on the poll icon in the WordPress text editor to open the poll embed dialog
4. Paste the ID you copied in the embed dialog

= What is the embed ID and where can I find it? =

Each poll has a unique ID which identifies it. The poll ID can be found in the poll embed button on the poll page.

= Can I embed a poll manually? =

Yes, just post the following syntax into any post/page: [socialpoll ID="xyz"], where the xyz represents the poll ID.
